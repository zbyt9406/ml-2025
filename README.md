Machine Learning Course Mini-Projects

This repository contains a series of four mini-projects completed for an introductory machine learning course. Each project is designed to implement and explore fundamental concepts and algorithms, ranging from supervised learning to reinforcement learning.

Projects Overview üìÇ


üß† Mini-Project 1: Classification & Linear Regression

This project covers the fundamentals of supervised learning. It involves implementing and analyzing models for two primary tasks: predicting categorical labels (Classification) and forecasting continuous values (Linear Regression).

üå≥Mini-Project 2: Decision Trees & Bayes

This project explores tree-based models and probabilistic classifiers. The focus is on understanding how these models make decisions and handle uncertainty.

‚ú® Mini-Project 3: SVM & Dimensionality Reduction

This project focuses on a powerful classification method and techniques for handling high-dimensional data. It covers Support Vector Machines for finding optimal decision boundaries and Principal Component Analysis for feature reduction.

ü§ñ Mini-Project 4: Reinforcement Learning

This project introduces the core principles of Reinforcement Learning. The goal was to build an agent that learns to operate in an environment by taking actions and observing the results, ultimately developing a policy to maximize its cumulative reward
